# Read-Locate-Copy-Code

My aim with this code is to further my programming understanding through the production 
of an app that can perform various file alterations, from locating files to editing, adding 
or stripping Exif metadata. Additional functionality such as image conversion and processing 
is a long term goal of mine and will be added over time.

Currently the app reads a text file which is supplied by user input, 
then searches a folder and copies found items to another folder based on user 
input.

The real aim here is to gain a clearer understanding of python and programming
in general for myself. I plan to play with PyPy, PSD-Tools, Exiftool Python Module, 
MATLAB, Pil and other modules in python that are related to image processing 
and metadata.

**Here's an example of the bare bones user interface:**

The code was first inspired by the this piece (linked below) that i found on stack-overflow, 
i have since made alterations but this piece of code was foundational. It helped me get my 
head around Name space issues, variable declaration and the humble for loop.
