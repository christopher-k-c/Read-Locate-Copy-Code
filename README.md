# Read-Locate-Copy-Code

The aim is to produce an app which can perform various file manipulations, 
from locating files to editing, adding or stripping Exif metadata. Potentially
even image resizing, colour profile conversion, file type conversion and more.

Currently all it does is read a text file which is supplied by user input, 
then searches a folder and copies found items to another folder based on user 
input. I copied the code which reads, searches and copies things from a 
stack overflow question, so it is not my original code. However i have made a 
few alterations but these are minor alerations.

The real aim here is to gain a clearer understanding of python and programming
in general for myself. I plan to play with MATLAB, Pil and other modules in python
that are related to image processing.
